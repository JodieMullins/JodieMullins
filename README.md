# Thank you! 

Of all the choices you had available, you've landed on my Github! I appreciate the time to check out what I've been working on! 

Currently, in July of 2025, most of these repositories are early-learning graveyards for a look into the basics from which I started. 
Why would I not delete them? Because it is worked completed and time accounted for in a pretty green square. It is time I would be more embarassed to erase than to accept it 
as a messy beginning of learning something new.

While I may not have updated this particular space much recently, I invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodiepdm), and ask me 
about my current projects, which may not always be strictly coding / so Github-centric.
